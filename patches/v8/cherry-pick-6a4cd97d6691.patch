Subject: [PATCH] Merged: [parser] Fix AST func reindexing for function fields

AST reindexing has to skip visiting fields that are already in the
member initializer, as they will have already been visited when
visiting said initializer. This is the case for private fields and
fields with computed names.

However, the reindexer was incorrectly assuming that all properties
with a FunctionLiteral value are methods (and thus not fields, and
can safely be visited). This is not the case for fields with
function expression values.

Now, we correctly use the class property's "kind" when making this
visitation decision.

(cherry picked from commit a769ea7a4462115579ba87bc16fbffbae01310c1)
